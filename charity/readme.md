* [Ethics Explainer: The principle of charity][ethic-explainer]:
  - arguments should be about learning truth and not winning
  - basic idea of charity is thinking well of people: assume rationality and
    intelligence, not advancing stupid or illogical ideas
  - almost everyone takes shortcuts when making arguments
  - advantages to principle of charity:
    1. showing respect to interlocutor
    2. exercise empathy and imagination
  - principle of charity does not imply tolerating the intolerable: after
    argument reconstruction, one responds
  - extreme opposite of charity is intentional misrepresentation, the straw man,
    which is a logical fallacy

* [Principle of Charity Lecture][charity-lecture]:
  - Why?
    1. It is generally the decent thing to do, especially in a dialogue.
    2. It helps keep us a dialogue on a rational track.
    3. It will help us avoid the common fallacy know as straw man.
    4. When you evaluate the most charitable interpretation of someone's
       argument and can still show that it is weak or fallacious, you have made
       a more effective criticism of the argument than if you were criticizing
       an uncharitable version of the argument.

* Critical Thinking: A Student's Introduction (5th ed.):
  - The Principle of Charity (p. 44): When interpreting an unclear passage,
    always give the speaker or writer the benefit of the doubt. Never attribute
    to an arguer a _weaker_ argument when the evidence reasonably permits us to
    attribute to him or her a _stronger_ one. And never interpret a passage as a
    _bad argument_ when the evidence reasonably permits us to interpret it as
    _not an argument at all_.
  - The Principle of Charity Test (p. 59): The principle of charity serves two
    important goals in critical thinking. First, it fosters goodwill and mutual
    understanding in argument by demanding that we treat the arguments of others
    with the same generous and respectful spirit that we would like others to
    treat our own arguments. Even more important, it promotes the discovery of
    truth by insisting that we confront arguments that we ourselves admit to be
    the strongest and most plausible versions of those arguments.
  - (p. 60): A word of caution, however: _The principle of charity should never
    be used to reinterpret bad arguments as good ones._ The principle of charity
    is a principle of interpretation, not a principle of argument repair. Its
    basic purpose, like that of the other three tests, is to help us decide what
    arguments are actually being offered, not to replace bad arguments with ones
    we think are better. Thus, the principle should be used only when there is
    genuine uncertainty about how an argument should be interpreted. It should
    not be used when it is clear what argument has actually been put forward.
  - Finding Missing Premises and Conclusions (p. 180):
    - In real life, people often leave parts of their arguments unstated.
    - There are two basic rules in filling in missing steps:
      1. _Faithfully interpret the arguer’s intentions._ The most important rule
         in filling in missing premises and conclusions is to be as accurate as
         possible in interpreting an arguer’s intent. A missing premise or
         conclusion is a genuine part of an argument only if it was implicitly
         understood to be part of the argument by the arguer himself.
         Consequently, we should always try to fill in a missing step in an
         argument in a way that the arguer himself would recognize as expressing
         his own thought. One way to determine this is to ask _what else the
         arguer must assume — that he does not say — to reach his conclusion_.
         All assumptions you add to the argument must be consistent with
         everything the arguer says.
      2. _Be charitable._ Sometimes it is difficult or impossible to know what
         unstated premise or conclusion an arguer had implicitly in mind. In
         such cases, the principle of charity requires that we interpret the
         argument as generously as possible. In general, this means that we
         should search for a way of completing the argument that (1) is a
         plausible way of interpreting the arguer’s uncertain intent and (2)
         makes the argument as good an argument as it can be. Such judgments
         require practice and skill. But you’ll seldom be far off the mark if
         you remember this simple golden rule: _Be as generous in inter- preting
         other people’s incompletely stated arguments as you would like them to
         be in interpreting your own._
