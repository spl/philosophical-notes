            The common sense behind the maxim is that one’s interlocutor’s silliness, beyond a certain point, is less likely than bad translation — or, in the domestic case, linguistic divergence.

            Donald Davidson applied Quine's principle of charity <q>across the board</q> to:

            [T]he principle directs [one to interpret] so as to read some of [one's] own standards of truth into the pattern of sentences held true by the speaker. The point of the principle is to make the speaker intelligible, since too great deviations from consistency and correctness leave no common ground on which to judge either conformity or difference.<sup style="font-size:60%">4</sup>
