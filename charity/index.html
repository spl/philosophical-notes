            The maxim of translation underlying all this is that assertions startlingly false on the face of them are likely to turn on hidden differences of language.

            The common sense behind the maxim is that one’s interlocutor’s silliness, beyond a certain point, is less likely than bad translation — or, in the domestic case, linguistic divergence.
