* [Ethics Explainer: The principle of charity][ethic-explainer]:
  - arguments should be about learning truth and not winning
  - basic idea of charity is thinking well of people: assume rationality and
    intelligence, not advancing stupid or illogical ideas
  - almost everyone takes shortcuts when making arguments
  - advantages to principle of charity:
    1. showing respect to interlocutor
    2. exercise empathy and imagination
  - principle of charity does not imply tolerating the intolerable: after
    argument reconstruction, one responds
  - extreme opposite of charity is intentional misrepresentation, the straw man,
    which is a logical fallacy

* [Principle of Charity Lecture][charity-lecture]:
  - Why?
    1. It is generally the decent thing to do, especially in a dialogue.
    2. It helps keep us a dialogue on a rational track.
    3. It will help us avoid the common fallacy know as straw man.
    4. When you evaluate the most charitable interpretation of someone's
       argument and can still show that it is weak or fallacious, you have made
       a more effective criticism of the argument than if you were criticizing
       an uncharitable version of the argument.
